1. Run the gui.py
2. Choose a major from the dropdown menu at the top
3. Type the classes (not case sensitive) for a semester in the textbox separated on individual lines
  -Ex: INST101
       PSYC100
       CCJS100
       BSCI135
  -No extra spaces or any other characters not apart of the course name
  -*If there are extra characters and/or a course name is SPELLED INCORRECTLY, the program will terminate (and a message will appear in the terminal)
   but the gui will still appear functional
  -The first semester is where you type courses you have credit for before the first semester at UMD
  -Once the courses have been typed in, press the "submit courses" button. That will lock in the courses to the graduation plan
  -After a slight delay (due to the webscraping), the semester number should update and this process can be repeated for each semester
4. After the final semester of classes are llocked in after pressing the "submit courses" button, the textbox should be empty
   At this point the submit graduation plan button should be pressed to run the graduation plan through the verification process
   The results of the tests will display on screen
   After results are displayed, close the gui to terminate the program


Sample graduation that will pass for the information science major:
  *Take out and/or replace some classes to see how those changes affect the results of the degree audit
  *And don't just copy and paste it because there will be an extra space at the end of the courses if you do that
