    Heres the idea of whats happening below:

    Assuming that some of the courses had genEd satisfactions with "or" situations...
    The or_queue is going to be populated with lists of those genEds (the "or" situations)
    An "or" situation occurs when a course can count towards only one of a few selected genEd satisfactions
    Example: the genEd satisfactions for HIST200 are: DSHS or DSHU
    The code from prp.py handles that by putting the genEds separated by an "or" in a list
    So the genEd attribute for HIST200 would be: ['DSHS', 'DSHU']
    This is an example of what the or_queue could look like:
        [['DSHU', 'DVUP'], ['DSHU', 'DVCC'], ['DSHS', 'DVUP', 'DSHU']]
    
    There is an initialized list, or_combinations, that will house all of the possible combinations
    Of the genEds from the or_queue
    The genEds in the or_queue will get cycled through in order to build the combinations

    At the start, the or_combinations list is empty, so the genEds in the first "or" situation will serve as the first combinations
    *combinations are represented as lists
    Example of starting with the genEds for HIST200: [['DSHS'], ['DSHU']]
    Now there are combinations to branch off of

    For each of the remaining "or" situations in the or_queue, every combination in or_combinations...
    will need to be copied enough times to attach a different genEd onto each one
    Walkthrough:
        or_combinations --> [['DSHS'], ['DSHU']]
        next "or" situation: ['DSHU', 'DVUP']
        make new combinations by adding each genEd in the "or" situation to each existing combination
        new combinations: ['DSHS', 'DSHU']
                          ['DSHS', 'DVUP']
                          ['DSHU', 'DSHU']
                          ['DSHU', 'DVUP']
        add the new combinations to or_combinations and get rid of the previous combinations
        or_combinations --> [['DSHS', 'DSHU'], ['DSHS', 'DVUP'], ['DSHU', 'DSHU'], ['DSHU', 'DVUP']]
        *repreat process with all "or" situations
    It works with any amount of genEds in the "or" situation
    Ex: If you have 4 combinations and the next "or" situation has 3 genEds, then you would end up with 12 new combinations
    *It may seem like the amount of combinations can get very large very fast,
     but there aren't too many "or" situations and students don't need a whole lot of genEd classes anyway,
     so the combination list will most likely be small
